# Multivariable Regression Valuation Model

This Jupyter notebook aims to explore and analyse housing data from Boston Massachusetts in the 1970's, split the data into training and test data, run a multivariable regression,
evaluate the model's coefficients and performance, transform the data to improve model performance and finally using the model to make predictions on house prices based on 
certain charateristics.
